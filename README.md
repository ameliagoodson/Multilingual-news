# Multilingual News Source app

## Description

This web application uses two news APIs to provide users
with multilingual news articles. Currently supported
languages are:

- English
- French
- German
- Italian
- Spanish

## APIs

Two APIs were used:

1. Contextual Web Search's News Search API for English
   language news sources. A number of free frontend news
   APIs were tested and this proved to be better than
   others. Available here:

   and
2. Newscatcher's News API for multilingual news sources.
